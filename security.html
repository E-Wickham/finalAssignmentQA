    <!--The Security page should accurately describe all security measures involved in the production of your site, including, but not limited to:
            any security-related HTTP headers, their values, and their purpose,
            any encryption of data in transit,
            any security features that are a result of not doing things,
            any security principles pertaining to the production of this site.

        <p>
            1. Security related headers

            All security headers have been set in the _Headers.txt file in the publish directory. each page has X-Frame-Options: DENY and a
            X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block. The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be 
            allowed to render a page in a frame and X-XSS-Protection stops pages from loading when the site detects reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
